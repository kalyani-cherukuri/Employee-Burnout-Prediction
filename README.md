 Employee Burnout Prediction

This project focuses on predicting employee burnout using data analysis and machine learning techniques. Burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged workplace stress. By leveraging employee data such as workload, resource allocation, mental fatigue score, and organizational factors, the system aims to predict burnout rates and provide early interventions.
